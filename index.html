  <h3>The Spread</h3>
  <p>As of today, Maj 15th 2020, the Corona pandemic has spread to an extend were almost all countries has some Corona-related fatalities. However, the spread by no means distributes evenly around the globe. In fact, USA and a handfull of European countries top the charts with most corona related deaths. As the virus quickly gained ground in such countries, the numer of casualities quickly rose to an alarming level.</p>

  <p>The Corona pandemic started in China during the end of 2019, and during the winter the virus slowly spread globally. Initially, the the rest of the world, looked upon how China handled the outbreak, in a manner that would not have been accepted, at least in the western countries. But as spring came, the virus outbreak that had previously been considered an epidemic, exploded in first Southern Europe, and later on also USA.</p>

          <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">

  <p>However, countries are no alike - neithter culturally, geographically, nor demographically. The size of the countries populations varies quite a lot. While some countries count the population in one-digit millions, others count in billions.</p>

  <p>In the media, stories of astounding numbers of corona-releated deaths in Italy, then Spain and later on USA and Great Britain have given the impression that especially USA suffers the pandemic. Measured by the absolute number of deths, this is indeed correct.</p>

  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-10 offset-sm-1">
          <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-21by9">

      </div>
  </div>

  <p>However, when compared relatively by deaths per capita, a quite another story unfolds. Then USA is no longer the the most affected county at all. In fact on the contrary. Surprisingly, a country like Belgium that had otherwise taken a relatively anonymous role the the race now takes the lead - with a noticable distance to the other countries. Also Sweden now gains it rightful place, while countries such as Denmark and Germany has less corona-related fatalities.</p>

  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-10 offset-sm-1">
          <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-21by9">

      </div>
  </div>

  <p>The cause of this variation across countries are many and far beyond the scope of this produciton. However, some noticable observations include that the relatively small difference between countries such af Denamrk and Sweden. These two countries have had very different strategies, but otherwise are very similar. Although not surprising, it is also clear that countries that did general shutdown of societal function have experienced a decrease in the number of deaths, while the development in other countries has been more linear.</p>





  <a id="impact"></a>
  <h3>The impact</h3>
  <h5>Flights</h5>
  <p>The global economy has been gravely affected by the pandemic. For instance airplane traffic saw an almost abrupt decrease, that was directly linked to spread of the Corona-pandemic and how countries saw the sudden need for a general shutdown of many societal functions.</p>

  <h5>Fossile prices</h5>
  <p>Also the the fossile fuels market saw an abrupt decline in prices. In fact, the oil market had at some point reached unprecedented negative prices. However, all goods were not affected equally. The natural gas prices for instance, were almost unaffected. </p>

  <a id="stocks"></a>
  <h5>Stocks values</h5>
  <p>The stocks data refres to most important country indexes like SNP 500 for the USA. The indexes usually aggregate infomation about stock performace, of a large group of companies from a given country. The discontinuity of the lines, comes from the fact that some of the stock exchanges were closed in the first half of April and the beginning of May. It is interesting to investigate, how the COVID impacted stock prices, and if the companies experience a recession.

  <p>In the figure above, we can observe varied decrease of the index values. However, the comparison between the countries can be hard, as the values are established by each national, stock exchnage separately. Therefore, in the next figure we will normalize them.</p>

  <p>The normalaized plot allows us to see thing more clearly. We have chosen the 2nd of January 2020, as the values to normalize the plots over, beacuse in January the outbreak was still in its early stage and mainly affecting Asian countries. This fact is reflected in the plot, as chinese index starts from much lower point in the beginning of February. While this index grows, european and american indexes start to lose value. The second drop comes in the last days of February and lasts for almost a month, when it reaches 30-40% decrease. However, some stocks react and recover better than others. Danish index was able to come back to its value from the beginning of the year. Howver, all the remaining ones, were not able to do that. The current situation doesn't look good for spanish, italian and french indexes.</p>





  <a id="hdi"></a>
  <h3>Human Development Index (HDI) and Testing</h3>
  <p>Human Development Index compares countries on both social and economic level. It is higly relevant for the COVID data to be correlated with it. Furthermore, testing data is the building block of all the other COVID-related metrics. The visuliaztion below, includes 74 countries, but initially only G7 countries are displayed. Countries are grouped into seven development categories, which allow to include or exclude larger groups of them (by clicking on the legend). The axes are customizable, as the reader can pick between HDI and testing values (per capita) for the x-axis. For the y-axis, cases, deaths and test (per capita) can be chosen. Finally more details are show with the hover tool, after navigating to the country of interest with a mouse. It is recommended to use the full screen button, in order to use the visualization to its full potential and take advantage of zoom in the toolbar to better inspect the plot. </p>

  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-10 offset-sm-1">
          <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
              <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="./plots/hdi-scatter.html"></iframe>
          </div>

      </div>
  </div>

  <p>The increasing trend of the COVID data over the HDI index seems peculiar to say the least. Could it be, that developed countries are affected by the COVID more, because of how massive the transfer of people and goods is? That's certainly one hypothesis. However, if the reader takes a look at the tests, another intresting phenomena can be learnt. Testing also increases with HDI value. This might mean, that the reason, behind low amount of cases and deaths in less developed countries, could be that test are not affordable or accessible there. Finally, investigating deaths per capita by tests per capita, we can see how Belgium and Iceland are clear outliers.</p>
